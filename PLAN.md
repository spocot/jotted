# Jotted — Implementation Plan

An Obsidian-like note-taking web application with React frontend and SQLite backend.

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite | Fast dev/build, modern React |
| Backend | Express.js + TypeScript | Lightweight, easy REST API |
| Database | SQLite via `better-sqlite3` | Synchronous, fast, FTS5, cross-platform |
| Rich Text | TipTap (ProseMirror) | Extensible, React-native, Markdown support |
| Graph | D3.js force-directed layout | Full control, interactive |
| State | Zustand | Minimal boilerplate, TypeScript-native |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first, rapid UI development |
| Monorepo | npm workspaces | Simple, no extra tooling |

**Desktop:** Not in scope (web-only MVP).

## Database Schema

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `notes` | Core notes: id, title, content, path, created_at, updated_at |
| `tags` | Unique tag names |
| `note_tags` | Many-to-many junction |
| `links` | Source→target note references (from `[[wikilinks]]`) |
| `notes_fts` | FTS5 virtual table on title + content for full-text search |

---

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/notes` | List notes (filter by folder, tag) |
| POST | `/api/notes` | Create note |
| GET | `/api/notes/:id` | Note detail (links, tags, backlinks) |
| PUT | `/api/notes/:id` | Update content → re-parse → update FTS |
| DELETE | `/api/notes/:id` | Delete note + clean up |
| GET | `/api/search?q=` | FTS5 full-text search |
| GET | `/api/search/suggest?q=` | Fast typeahead (title) |
| GET | `/api/tags` | All tags with note counts |
| GET | `/api/tags/:name/notes` | Notes for a tag |
| GET | `/api/graph` | All nodes + edges for global graph |
| GET | `/api/graph/:id` | Subgraph centered on a note |
| GET | `/api/notes/:id/backlinks` | Notes linking to a note |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Scaffolding

- Init root `package.json` with npm workspaces
- `packages/client`: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Zustand + React Router
- `packages/server`: Express + TypeScript + `tsx` + `better-sqlite3`
- Shared `tsconfig.base.json`, root dev script with `concurrently`
- `better-sqlite3` cross-platform build config
- Vite proxy `/api` → `localhost:3000`
- Verify `npm run dev` starts both client and server

### Phase 2: Database Layer & Content Parser

- SQL schema: `notes`, `tags`, `note_tags`, `links`, `notes_fts` (FTS5)
- Repository pattern classes
- Wikilink parser: `\[\[([^\]]+)\]\]` → resolve to note IDs
- Tag parser: `#tag` → upsert into `note_tags`
- FTS index rebuilt on note save
- Raw `better-sqlite3` prepared statements (no ORM)

### Phase 3: Backend API

- Express router per domain
- All endpoints from API table above
- Validation, error handling middleware, CORS

### Phase 4: Frontend Foundation & Note CRUD

- React Router: `/`, `/note/:id`, `/search`, `/graph`, `/tags`
- Zustand stores: `useNotesStore`, `useUIStore`, `useTagStore`
- API client module
- Sidebar: note list, folder tree, create/delete
- Note editor page with auto-save
- Textarea-based editing (placeholder until TipTap)

### Phase 5: Rich Text Editor (TipTap)

- TipTap + React wrapper
- Core extensions: headings, bold, italic, lists, code, blockquote, tasks
- Custom `Wikilink` extension: inline link + autocomplete
- Custom `Tag` extension: chip + autocomplete
- TipTap JSON ↔ Markdown sync
- Debounced auto-save (500ms)

### Phase 6: Tagging System UI

- Tag chips inline in editor
- Tag filter pane in sidebar
- Click tag to filter note list
- Tag management: rename, delete, view notes

### Phase 7: Backlinks & Note Connections

- Backlinks panel in note editor
- Unlinked mentions detection
- Visual indicator for notes with backlinks

### Phase 8: Graph View

- D3.js force-directed graph
- Global graph + per-note subgraph
- Zoom, pan, drag, click-to-navigate
- Tag-based filtering

### Phase 9: Full-Text Search

- Global search bar with typeahead
- Search results page with highlighted snippets
- Filters: tag, folder, date, sort order
- Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+F`

### Phase 10: Polish & UX

- Dark mode (Tailwind `dark:`)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Note preview popover on wikilink hover
- Resizable sidebar
- Loading skeletons, empty states, toasts
- Command palette (`Ctrl+P`)

### Phase 11: Testing & Hardening

- Unit tests: parser, repositories, API handlers (vitest)
- Component tests: Sidebar, NoteEditor, SearchBar, GraphView (RTL)
- E2E: Playwright critical paths
- Edge cases: cycles, special characters, 10k benchmark

### Phase 12: Folder Organization & File System Navigation

- Backend endpoint: `GET /api/folders` — hierarchical folder listing with note counts
- Tree component in the sidebar with expand/collapse
- Drag notes between folders
- Create/rename/delete folders from sidebar
- Breadcrumb in the editor showing note path
- Filter notes by folder in the note list

### Phase 13: Image & File Attachments

- Server upload endpoint + static serving
- TipTap Image extension rendering uploaded images
- Drag-and-drop + paste handler for images
- Inline image resizing
- File attachment list / gallery view

### Phase 14: Calendar Page & ICS Calendar Sync

- New route `/calendar` with a month-view calendar grid
- Backend endpoint `GET /api/calendar` — returns notes bucketed by day (created + modified counts, note IDs per date)
- Hover tooltip on each day shows lists of notes created and modified on that date, with links to open them
- Visual indicators (dots/icons) on days that have note activity
- Toggle between created, modified, or combined view
- ICS calendar sync:
  - Backend fetches and parses ICS files from configured URLs at regular intervals
  - Events merged into calendar view alongside note activity
  - Settings UI to add/remove ICS URLs (supports CalDAV publish URLs, public calendars, etc.)
  - Periodic background refresh (configurable interval, default 15 minutes)
  - Graceful fallback if sync fails (note-only mode with sync error indicator)
- Calendar date click opens / creates a Daily Note for that day (ties into Phase 16)

### Phase 15: Redux & RTK Query Migration

- Install `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux` dependencies
- Create Redux store foundation:
  - `src/store/redux/store.ts` — `configureStore` with reducer map
  - `src/store/redux/hooks.ts` — typed `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch` exports
- Create RTK Query API slice (`src/store/redux/api.ts`) with `createApi` + `fetchBaseQuery`:
  - Base query configured for `/api` prefix with JSON `Content-Type` header
  - **Cache tag system** for automatic invalidation:
    - `"Note"` (per-id) and `"NoteList"` for notes
    - `"Tag"` (per-id) and `"TagList"` for tags
    - `"Folder"` for folder tree
    - `"Upload"` (per-note-id) for uploads
    - `"Calendar"` for calendar data
  - **Query endpoints** (all GET → `query` with `providesTags`):
    - Notes: `getNotes`, `getNote`, `getNoteBacklinks`, `getNoteUnlinkedMentions`, `getNoteByTitle`, `getBacklinkCounts`
    - Search: `searchNotes`, `searchSuggest`
    - Tags: `getTags`, `getTagNotes`
    - Graph: `getGraph`, `getGraphSub`
    - Folders: `getFolders`
    - Uploads: `getUploads`
    - Calendar: `getCalendarData`, `getOutlookEvents`, `getOutlookStatus`
  - **Mutation endpoints** (POST/PUT/DELETE → `mutation` with `invalidatesTags`):
    - `createNote` → invalidates `"NoteList"`
    - `updateNote` → invalidates [`"NoteList"`, `{type: "Note", id}`]
    - `deleteNote` → invalidates [`"NoteList"`, `{type: "Note", id}`]
    - `addNoteTag`, `removeNoteTag` → invalidates `{type: "Note", id: noteId}`
    - `renameTag`, `deleteTag` → invalidates [`"TagList"`, `"NoteList"`]
    - `renameFolder`, `deleteFolder` → invalidates `"Folder"`
    - `uploadFile` → invalidates `{type: "Upload", id: noteId}`
    - `deleteUpload` → invalidates `"Upload"`
    - `configureOutlookIcsUrl`, `clearOutlookConfig` → invalidates `"Calendar"`
- Migrate Zustand stores to RTK Query hooks:
  - `useNoteStore` → removed; components use `useGetNotesQuery`, `useGetNoteQuery`, and mutation hooks (`useCreateNoteMutation`, `useUpdateNoteMutation`, `useDeleteNoteMutation`)
  - `useTagStore` → removed; components use `useGetTagsQuery`, `useRenameTagMutation`, `useDeleteTagMutation`
  - Keep `useToastStore` and `useUIStore` as-is (purely client-side, no API dependency)
  - Remove manual race-condition guard (`selectVersion` counter) — RTK Query handles stale responses via tag lifecycle
- Wrap app in `<Provider store={store}>` in `main.tsx`
- Remove `packages/client/src/api/client.ts` — all call sites migrated to auto-generated hooks
- Update test files: migrate store-dependent tests to use `setupApiStore` test helper or mock RTK Query hooks
- Run `npx -w packages/client tsc --noEmit` and `npm run test -w packages/client` to verify no regressions

### Phase 16: Remote Client / Docker Server Deployment

- Deploy client as a static SPA on GitHub Pages (or any static host)
- Package server as a Docker container for users to run locally
- Runtime-configurable server URL in the client (settings UI + localStorage)
- Dynamic base URL in RTK Query so API calls go to the user's local server
- Fix upload image URLs to use absolute paths (prefixed with configured server URL)
- Server reads PORT/HOST/DB_PATH/UPLOADS_DIR from environment variables
- GitHub Actions workflow to build client and deploy to GitHub Pages on push to main
- CORS: server's existing `app.use(cors())` already allows all origins, no change needed
- Mixed-content note: GitHub Pages serves HTTPS, but modern browsers allow `http://localhost` from HTTPS pages as a special case

### Phase 17: Daily Notes / Journal

- "Open Today" button in the header and keyboard shortcut — opens or creates a note with title `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Journal page at `/journal` — a reverse-chronological timeline of daily notes
- Automatic daily note creation on first open of the day (configurable)
- Daily note template: pre-populates with date, day of week, and a "## Tasks" / "## Notes" structure
- Calendar integration: clicking a date on the calendar opens the daily note for that day
- Streak counter (consecutive days with a daily note)

### Phase 18: Note Version History

- New `note_versions` table: `id, note_id, content, title, created_at` — stores a snapshot on each save
- Server-side: on every note update, insert a version row (cheap — text snapshots)
- Backend endpoint: `GET /api/notes/:id/versions` — list versions with timestamps
- Backend endpoint: `GET /api/notes/:id/versions/:versionId` — get full snapshot content
- Backend endpoint: `POST /api/notes/:id/versions/:versionId/restore` — restore a version
- "Version History" panel in the note editor (toggleable sidebar/tab)
- Timeline view showing versions with formatted timestamps and character-count diffs
- Side-by-side or unified diff view between selected versions
- "Restore" button with confirmation dialog

### Phase 19: Mind Map / Canvas View

- New route `/canvas` with a free-form infinite canvas
- New `canvases` table: `id, title, data (JSON)`, and `canvas_items` table: `id, canvas_id, note_id (nullable), x, y, width, height, color, text, type`
- Canvas data model: items are nodes (note cards, text boxes, images) positioned absolutely; edges are connectors between items
- Drag to position items; resize handles on selection
- Toolbar: add text box, add note pin, draw connector, delete, color picker
- Pin existing notes into the canvas — displays note title + snippet, click to open
- Connector lines (straight or curved) between items, draggable endpoints
- Auto-save canvas state as JSON to the server on changes
- Multiple canvases with a sidebar list to switch between them
- Export canvas as PNG/SVG

### Phase 20: Canvas — Image Items

- Add "Add Image" toolbar button alongside Text Box and Note Pin
- Image upload modal reusing the existing upload infrastructure (Phase 13):
  - Drop zone or file picker for new uploads
  - Browse existing uploads from the gallery
  - Filter uploads by note association or show all
- Render image items on the canvas:
  - Display image at original aspect ratio with the upload URL as `<img>` source
  - Maintain `width`/`height` from the item (defaults to the image's natural dimensions)
  - Resize handle works the same as text items (maintains aspect ratio optionally)
- Double-click on an image item opens the full image in a lightbox
- Drag-and-drop an image file from the desktop onto the canvas creates a new image item
- Paste an image from the clipboard onto the canvas creates a new image item
- Server: the `canvas_items` table already supports `type = 'image'` — no schema change needed
- Client: update `CanvasItem` rendering in `CanvasPage.tsx` to handle `type === "image"` with an `<img>` element instead of text
- Deleted image items do not delete the underlying upload (uploads are shared media)

### Phase 21: Canvas — Multi-Select & Batch Operations

- Shift-click to toggle items into a multi-selection set
- Rubber-band / lasso selection:
  - Drag on empty canvas space draws a blue selection rectangle
  - Any item intersecting the rectangle becomes selected
  - Works in "Select" tool mode only
- Visual treatment:
  - Selected items show ring highlight (existing single-select ring)
  - Multi-selected items show the same ring; a selection count badge appears in the toolbar ("3 selected")
- Batch operations (apply to all selected items):
  - **Move** — drag any selected item moves all selected items by the same delta
  - **Delete** — toolbar delete button removes all selected items + their edges
  - **Color change** — color picker applies to all selected items
  - **Bring to front** — raises all selected items to the top (preserving relative order)
  - **Resize** — resize handle on any selected item resizes all proportionally (optional stretch vs maintain individual sizes)
- Click on empty canvas deselects all
- `scheduleAutoSave` already handles arrays — save all changed items in one batch call
- Multi-select state: `selectedItemIds: Set<string>` replaces `selectedItemId: string | null`

### Phase 22: Canvas — Undo/Redo

- In-memory undo/redo stack that snapshots items + edges before each mutation
- Stack design:
  - Each entry stores `{ items: CanvasItem[]; edges: CanvasEdge[] }` — full state snapshot
  - Max stack depth: 100 entries (configurable)
  - After a new action, redo history is discarded (linear undo model)
- Actions that create a snapshot:
  - Item added/deleted
  - Item moved (snapshot at drag start, one entry for the whole drag)
  - Item resized (snapshot at resize start, one entry for the whole resize)
  - Item text edited (snapshot at blur, not per-keystroke)
  - Item color changed
  - Edge added/deleted
  - Bring to front
  - Paste / duplicate
- Actions that do NOT create a snapshot:
  - Pan/zoom (viewport only, no data change)
  - Text editing in progress (only finalized on blur)
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Ctrl+Z` — undo
  - `Ctrl+Shift+Z` or `Ctrl+Y` — redo
- Toolbar buttons: undo / redo buttons next to the zoom controls (disabled when stack is empty)
- The auto-save debounce (1s) continues to fire — undoing does not cancel a pending save; it saves the reverted state on the next debounce tick
- No server-side change — undo/redo is entirely client-side

### Phase 23: Canvas — Snap-to-Grid & Alignment Guides

- Grid overlay on the canvas:
  - Toggleable via a toolbar button (grid icon)
  - Dot grid rendered via CSS background with `background-image: radial-gradient(circle, ...)`
  - Configurable grid size: small (20px), medium (40px default), large (80px)
  - Grid visible only when enabled; hidden on export PNG
- Snap behavior:
  - When dragging an item, snap its top-left corner to the nearest grid intersection
  - When resizing, snap width/height to grid increments
  - Snap threshold: within 50% of grid size (e.g., 20px for a 40px grid)
  - Items can be placed freely when grid snap is off
  - "Snap to grid" toggle button in toolbar (separate from grid visibility)
- Smart alignment guides (when grid snap is off):
  - During drag, detect when the dragged item's edges or center align with any other item's edges or center
  - Render thin colored guide lines (blue, same as Figma) at alignment points
  - Alignment tolerance: 5px
  - Supported alignments:
    - Top edges, bottom edges, left edges, right edges
    - Vertical center, horizontal center
    - Same for multiple items (if 3+ items share an alignment, show extended line)
- Distribution guide:
  - When 3+ selected items are dragged, show equal-spacing indicators if items are evenly distributed horizontally or vertically
- All guide logic is purely client-side math — no server involvement

### Phase 24: Canvas — Auto-Layout

- Add an "Auto-Layout" dropdown/split-button next to the export button with two modes:
  - **Force-Directed Layout** — arranges items using a force simulation
  - **Tree Layout** — arranges items in a rooted hierarchy
- Force-Directed Layout:
  - Items are nodes, edges are links
  - Use `d3-force` simulation (reuse from Phase 8 Graph View, but on canvas coordinates)
  - Forces: charge (items repel), link (edges pull connected items together), center (pull everything toward center of canvas)
  - Simulation runs for ~300 iterations or until alpha is low
  - Animate the transition: interpolate each item's x/y from current to target over ~500ms (CSS transition or requestAnimationFrame)
  - After layout settles, auto-save the new positions
- Tree Layout:
  - User picks a root item (or the layout picks the item with the most connections)
  - Arranges items in a top-down or left-to-right tree
  - Levels based on shortest path from root (BFS)
  - Siblings evenly spaced horizontally; levels evenly spaced vertically
  - Handles cycles gracefully (use BFS, ignore back-edges for layout)
  - Edge type (straight/curved) can auto-switch to "curved" for tree layout
- Progress indicator: if layout takes >200ms, show a small spinner in the toolbar
- Edge labels: after layout, optionally show edge labels ("depends on", "relates to") via a small text overlay on the connector midpoint
- All changes go through the same auto-save mechanism — no new server endpoints

### Phase 25: DataView / Query Engine

- Custom TipTap extension that renders `dataview` code blocks as live interactive tables/lists
- Query DSL (simple, not full SQL):
  - `LIST FROM <source>` — bullet list of notes matching tag/folder
  - `TABLE <fields> FROM <source> WHERE <condition> SORT <field>` — table view
  - Sources: `#tag`, `"folder"`, `/calendar` (notes by date range)
  - Conditionals: `created >= date(...)`, `updated <= date(...)`, `contains(title, ...)`
- Server endpoint `POST /api/dataview/query` — accepts query AST or raw query string → parses → executes against SQLite
- Result caching with cache-busting when related notes change
- Auto-refresh on note open; manual refresh button
- Editor integration: code block language picker includes `dataview`

### Phase 26: Reminders & Alerts

- New `reminders` table: `id, note_id, remind_at (datetime), title, done (boolean), created_at`
- Backend CRUD: `POST /api/notes/:id/reminders`, `GET /api/reminders` (due soon), `PUT /api/reminders/:id/done`, `DELETE /api/reminders/:id`
- Server-side periodic check: `setInterval` every 30s queries for due, undismissed reminders
- Client polls `/api/reminders` on a timer (every 30s) or uses SSE/WebSocket for push
- Browser Notification API: request permission, show native notification when a reminder fires
- In-app toast notification (reuse ToastContainer) with snooze (5 min / 15 min / 1 hr) and dismiss buttons
- Reminder picker UI in the note editor: datetime picker in a context menu or footer bar
- Calendar integration: reminder indicators (bell icon) on days in the calendar view

### Phase 27: Testing & Hardening (New Features)

- Unit tests for all new repositories and API handlers (calendar, versions, canvases, dataview query parser, reminders)
- Component tests for CalendarPage, DailyJournal, VersionHistoryPanel, CanvasView, DataView blocks, ReminderPicker
- E2E: full calendar workflow, version restore flow, canvas create/edit/export, dataview rendering
- Edge cases: ICS URL unreachable/malformed, large canvas performance, version storage limits (oldest purge), reminder timezone handling

### Phase 28: Templates (Notes + Projects) ✅ *(tests pending)*

**Data Model:**

- New `templates` table: `id, type (note|project), name, description, content (JSON blob), created_at, updated_at`
  - **Note template `content`** schema: `{ title: string; body: TipTap JSON; tags: string[]; folder: string; }`
  - **Project template `content`** schema:
    ```json
    {
      "groups": [
        {
          "name": "Development",
          "columns": [
            { "name": "Backlog", "color": "#94a3b8" },
            { "name": "In Progress", "color": "#3b82f6" },
            { "name": "Done", "color": "#22c55e" }
          ],
          "artifacts": [
            { "type": "note", "name": "Architecture Decision Record" },
            { "type": "note", "name": "API Spec" }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

**Backend (routes/templates.ts + db/template-repository.ts):**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/templates?type=note/project` | List templates (filtered by type) |
| POST | `/api/templates` | Create template |
| GET | `/api/templates/:id` | Get template detail |
| PUT | `/api/templates/:id` | Update template |
| DELETE | `/api/templates/:id` | Delete template |
| POST | `/api/templates/:id/apply?target=note/project` | Instantiate template → create note or project with groups/columns/cards/artifacts |

- `TemplateRepository` with prepared statements for all CRUD
- `POST /apply` for notes: creates a new note with title, body, tags, folder from template (replacing `{{date}}` and `{{title}}` variables)
- `POST /apply` for projects: creates a new project, then groups, then per-group columns (with color), then per-group artifacts as `project_artifacts` rows

**Frontend:**

- `TemplatesPage` (`/templates`) — grid of template cards grouped by type; create/edit/delete
- `TemplateCard` component — shows name, description, type badge, apply button
- `TemplateEditorModal` — inline form to create/edit template:
  - For note templates: capture current note title + editor content + tags + folder
  - For project templates: dynamic form to add groups, each group with columns (name + color) and predefined artifacts
- `TemplatePickerModal` — reusable modal shown on new-note and new-project creation; tabs for "Blank" and "From template"
  - New note: integrates into the existing new-note flow (sidebar button triggers picker)
  - New project: adds a "From Template" tab in the project creation dialog alongside "Blank"
- **Note editor**: "Save as template" action (menu item or toolbar button) — captures current title, TipTap JSON content, tags, folder path
- **Built-in defaults** (seeded via migration or inline):
  - **Note defaults**: "Daily Note" (`## Tasks\n## Notes`), "Meeting Notes" (`## Attendees\n## Agenda\n## Action Items`), "To-Do" (`## To-Do\n## In Progress\n## Done`)
  - **Project defaults**:
    - "Software Project" — groups: Development, QA, Documentation; each with standard kanban columns + typical artifact notes
    - "Marketing Campaign" — groups: Creative, Social Media, Analytics
    - "Research Project" — groups: Literature Review, Experiments, Publication
- **"Save Project as Template"** button on ProjectOverviewPage — captures current groups, columns, and artifact definitions
- **Template variables**: `{{date}}`, `{{title}}`, `{{today}}` replaced on instantiation; new variables `{{project_name}}`, `{{group_name}}` for project templates

### Phase 29: Export / Import

- Export single note as Markdown
- Export all notes as ZIP of `.md` files
- Import from Markdown files
- Obsidian vault import (folder structure, wikilinks, tags)
- Export as PDF (browser print)

### Phase 30: Code Syntax Highlighting

- Add highlight.js or Shiki
- TipTap extension for code block highlighting
- Language selector
- Copy-to-clipboard button

### Phase 31: Infinite Scalability (Pagination + SQL Pushdown)

- Database indexes for sort/filter columns
- Offset-based pagination with `PageRequest`/`PageResponse` types
- SQL pushdown for filtering, sorting, and counting
- Refactor `NoteRepository`, `TagRepository`, `LinkRepository` for targeted queries
- Paginated API endpoints with `limit`/`offset`
- Client pagination in Sidebar, NoteListPage, TagsPage, SearchPage, GraphPage, CommandPalette, BacklinksPanel
- Remove `getAllLinks()` and N+1 query patterns

### Phase 32: Projects (Kanban Boards & Artifact Registry)

- **Data model**: `projects`, `project_groups`, `project_columns`, `project_cards`, `project_artifacts` tables
- **Groups**: Each project has multiple groups (workstreams, BAU tracks, etc.) — each with its own kanban board and artifact collection
- **Kanban per group**: Columns with cards, drag-and-drop between columns, card positions via REAL ordering
- **Card details**: Title, description, due date, optional note link (search and link existing notes)
- **Artifact registry per group + global**: Collect corporate project documents as typed references (note, canvas, canvas item, image, kanban card, external link)
- **Drag-and-drop**: Custom `useMouseDrag` hook (shared primitive extracted from canvas patterns) for card movement between columns and column reordering
- **Shared DnD primitive**: `useMouseDrag` hook handles mousedown/mousemove/mouseup lifecycle; reused by both canvas and kanban

### Phase 33: Architecture Diagramming

- **New shape types** on canvas: `rectangle`, `rounded_rectangle`, `circle`, `diamond`, `cylinder`, `cloud`, `hexagon` — rendered as SVG elements with centered labels
- **Shape palette**: Toolbar dropdown to select and place diagram shapes on the canvas
- **Smart connectors**: Edge labels, arrowheads (start/end), dashed/dotted line styles
- **Connection ports**: Edges snap to shape edge midpoints (N/S/E/W) instead of center
- **SVG export**: Export canvas as `.svg` alongside existing PNG export
- **Diagram template**: "New Diagram" preset (grid on, snap on, shape palette open) — same canvas data model
- **Schema**: `ALIER TABLE canvas_edges` to add `label`, `style`, `arrow_start`, `arrow_end` columns

### Phase 34: Bug Fixes & UI Improvements

**Templates — Critical Fixes:**

- **TemplatePickerModal defaults to wrong tab** (`TemplatePickerModal.tsx`): Currently defaults to `"template"` tab. Change default to `"blank"` since most users want blank creation first.
- **Blank tab has no action button** (`TemplatePickerModal.tsx:67-71`): The "Blank" tab shows "Close this dialog to proceed" with no button. Add a "Create Blank" button that directly creates the note/project without requiring the user to close the modal.
- **`handleApply` in TemplatesPage doesn't navigate** (`TemplatesPage.tsx:50-58`): After applying a template, a toast is shown but the user isn't navigated to the created note/project. The `applyTemplate` mutation returns the created entity — navigate to it using its type (note → `/note/:id`, project → `/project/:id`).
- **Template variable replacement corrupts TipTap JSON** (`routes/templates.ts:119-121`): Simple `string.replace` for `{{date}}`/`{{today}}` on raw body content can corrupt JSON structure. Fix: only replace variables in the `title` field, or parse TipTap JSON and walk the node tree to replace text nodes.
- **Template tag creation bypasses TagRepository** (`routes/templates.ts:128-135`): Uses `(noteRepo as any).db` to directly run SQL. Refactor to use `TagRepository` or add a `createTagsForNote(noteId, tagNames)` method to the repository layer.
- **Project template doesn't preserve column colors** (`ProjectOverviewPage.tsx:162-163`): When saving a project as a template, column colors are always `""`. Read the actual column color from the project data (currently columns don't have a `color` field in the DB — add one if needed, or store a default).
- **TemplateEditorModal requires raw JSON for project templates** (`TemplateEditorModal.tsx:156-161`): Replace the raw JSON textarea with a structured form: dynamic list of groups, each with editable columns (name + color picker) and artifacts (name + type dropdown).

**Projects — Critical Fixes:**

- **Kanban card drag-and-drop between columns is broken** (`KanbanCard.tsx`, `KanbanColumn.tsx`): `KanbanCard` uses custom mouse-based DnD (manual ghost element via `onMouseDown`), but `KanbanColumn` uses HTML5 `onDragOver`/`onDrop` which reads `e.dataTransfer.getData("text/plain")`. Since the card never calls `dataTransfer.setData()`, the `cardId` is always empty and `onCardDrop` never fires. Fix: Make `KanbanCard` use native HTML5 DnD (`draggable`, `onDragStart` with `dataTransfer.setData`) instead of the custom mouse ghost approach, or make `KanbanColumn` detect drops via mouse events as well.
- **`ArtifactPickerModal` search doesn't store results** (`ArtifactPickerModal.tsx:44-51`): `handleSearch()` returns results but never sets them in state. Add `const results = await ...; setSearchResults(results.items);` and add `searchResults` state + render the results list with click-to-select.
- **Artifact count display concatenates numbers** (`ProjectOverviewPage.tsx:279-283`): Shows `Artifacts: {globalArtifacts.length}{groups.reduce(...)}` which concatenates digits. Fix: Add a separator and label, e.g., `Artifacts: {global} global, {group} in groups`.
- **Project delete doesn't use `.unwrap()`** (`ProjectsPage.tsx:49`): `await deleteProject(id)` doesn't unwrap, so failures are silently swallowed. Add `.unwrap()` and wrap in try/catch with toast.
- **Project context menu doesn't close on outside click** (`ProjectsPage.tsx:158-168`): The delete menu stays open when clicking elsewhere. Add a `useEffect` with a document click listener when `menuOpen` is set, or use a popover component.

**Canvas & Architecture Diagramming — Critical Fixes:**

- **`scheduleAutoSave` loses edge properties** (`CanvasPage.tsx:266-271`): The batch update payload omits `label`, `edgeStyle`, `arrowStart`, `arrowEnd`. Add these fields to the edge mapping in `scheduleAutoSave`.
- **SVG export missing edge labels, arrowheads, and styles** (`CanvasPage.tsx:1535-1549`): Add `<text>` for edge labels, `marker-start`/`marker-end` for arrowheads, and `stroke-dasharray` for dashed/dotted styles in `handleExportSvg`.
- **PNG export doesn't render shapes as their actual geometry** (`CanvasPage.tsx:1477-1484`): Currently all non-image items are drawn as filled rectangles. Add proper canvas drawing for each shape type (arcs for circles, polygon paths for diamonds/hexagons, bezier curves for clouds).
- **"New Diagram" sets state after navigation** (`CanvasPage.tsx:385-395`): `handleCreateDiagram` navigates first, then sets `showGrid`/`snapToGrid`. Fix: Set grid/snap state before navigation, or pass them as URL params / initialize them in the canvas load effect.
- **No UI to edit edge properties** (new feature within bug fix): Add a floating panel or inline editor when an edge is selected. Panel includes: text input for label, dropdown for line style (solid/dashed/dotted), toggle for start/end arrowheads, button for straight/curved toggle.

**UI Polish (lower priority):**

- Loading states for template operations (apply, create, delete)
- Confirmation dialog for template deletion
- Keyboard navigation in TemplatePickerModal and ArtifactPickerModal (arrow keys, Enter to select)
- Mobile-responsive layout for ProjectsPage and CanvasPage toolbar

### Phase 35: Project Management Enhancements

- **Card Labels/Tags**: Color-coded labels on kanban cards (priority, type, status). New `project_labels` table with `id, project_id, name, color`. New `project_card_labels` junction table. Label picker in CardEditor. Label filter in ProjectGroupPage.
- **Card Checklists**: Sub-task checklists within cards. New `project_card_checklists` table with `id, card_id, text, position, done`. Checklist UI in CardEditor with add/remove/toggle/reorder. Progress bar on KanbanCard showing completion %.
- **Card Comments/Activity Log**: Comment thread on cards. New `project_card_comments` table with `id, card_id, content, created_at`. Comment list in CardEditor with add/delete. Activity feed showing card moves, edits, comments.
- **Project Timeline/Gantt View**: New `/project/:id/timeline` route. Horizontal bar chart using card due dates and project start/end dates. Drag to adjust dates. Milestone markers.
- **Milestone Markers**: New `project_milestones` table with `id, project_id, title, date, completed`. Milestone list in ProjectOverviewPage. Visual markers on timeline view.
- **Card Filtering & Search**: Filter bar in ProjectGroupPage with text search, label filter, due date range, linked note filter. Search across all groups in a project.
- **Bulk Card Operations**: Shift-click or checkbox selection on cards. Batch move, archive, delete, label assignment. Selection count indicator in toolbar.
- **Card Sorting**: Sort dropdown in KanbanColumn header (by due date, title, created date). Applies within each column.
- **Project Analytics Dashboard**: New `/project/:id/analytics` route. Charts: card distribution by column (pie), completion rate over time (line), cards by label (bar). Use a lightweight chart library (recharts or similar).
- **Card Templates**: Predefined card structures (bug report, feature request, meeting note). New `project_card_templates` table. Template picker in CardEditor "New Card" flow.

---

### Phase 36: Architecture Canvas Enhancements

- **Edge Property Editor**: Floating panel when an edge is selected. Inputs for label text, line style dropdown, arrowhead toggles, straight/curved toggle. Panel positions near the edge midpoint.
- **Shape Connection Port Visualization**: On hover over a diagram shape, show small dots at N/S/E/W ports. Highlight the nearest port when dragging a connection line. Visual feedback for valid/invalid connection targets.
- **Shape Grouping**: Select multiple shapes → "Group" action. Groups move/resize as a unit. Ungroup action. Visual container border around grouped shapes. Group label.
- **Stencil Library**: Sidebar panel with pre-built diagram templates: AWS architecture (EC2, S3, RDS icons), ERD (entity/relationship), C4 model (container/component), network topology (router/switch/server). Drag from stencil to canvas.
- **Mini-map**: Small overview minimap in the bottom-right corner of the canvas. Shows all items as colored dots/rectangles. Viewport rectangle shows current view. Click to navigate.
- **Shape Text Styling**: Toolbar controls for font size, bold/italic when a shape is selected. Stored as item properties (fontSize, fontWeight, fontStyle).
- **Export to Mermaid**: Generate Mermaid diagram-as-code syntax from canvas. Map shapes to Mermaid node types, edges to Mermaid relationships. Copy-to-clipboard and download.
- **Shape Resize Constraints**: Lock aspect ratio toggle per shape. Min/max size constraints per shape type (circles maintain equal width/height). Shift+resize for proportional scaling.
- **Canvas Versioning**: Named snapshots of canvas state. "Save Version" button with optional description. Version list panel with timestamps and thumbnails. Restore to any version.
- **Keyboard-driven Shape Placement**: After selecting a shape from palette, use arrow keys to nudge position, Tab to cycle shapes, Enter to confirm placement, Escape to cancel.

### Phase 38: Milestones — Full Implementation

Upgrade the basic milestone CRUD (currently just title + due date, embedded in ProjectOverviewPage) into a complete milestone tracking system.

**Data Model Changes:**
- Add `completed` (INTEGER, 0/1) and `completed_at` (TEXT, nullable) columns to `project_milestones` via migration
- New `project_milestone_cards` M:N join table: `milestone_id` + `card_id` with FK cascade deletes

**Backend:**
| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| PATCH | `/api/projects/:id/milestones/:mid/toggle` | Toggle completion (sets `completed` + `completed_at`) |
| POST | `/api/projects/:id/milestones/:mid/cards` | Link cards to milestone |
| DELETE | `/api/projects/:id/milestones/:mid/cards/:cardId` | Unlink card from milestone |
| GET | `/api/projects/:id/milestones/:mid/cards` | List cards linked to milestone |

**Frontend — New Page (`ProjectMilestonesPage` at `/project/:id/milestones`):**
- Completion progress bar ("4 of 10 completed — 40%")
- Filter: All / Pending / Completed tabs
- Sort: by due date, title, position (dropdown)
- Inline add form: title, optional description, due date picker
- Milestone list items: checkbox toggle → strikethrough if complete, description (expandable), due date with overdue/upcoming/completed color coding, edit/delete buttons
- Drag-to-reorder via existing `useMouseDrag` + `updateMilestone({ position })`
- Empty state with prompt and create button

**Frontend — Integration Points:**
- ProjectOverviewPage: replace inline milestone list with summary card (+ link to full page)
- ProjectTimelinePage: render milestones as diamond markers alongside card dots, color-coded by status
- ProjectAnalyticsPage: add milestone stats card (completed %, overdue count, upcoming count) + milestone timeline chart
- KanbanCard: show linked milestone badges (flag icon + truncated title, color-coded)

**Routing:** `<Route path="/project/:id/milestones" element={<ProjectMilestonesPage />} />`

**Navigation:** "Milestones" button in ProjectOverviewPage header (next to Analytics and Timeline).



A developer/power-user page for browsing all database tables, viewing row data in a tabular list, and inspecting individual rows as JSON.

**New route file** (`packages/server/src/routes/inquiry.ts`), mounted at `/api/inquiry`:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/inquiry/tables` | List all user-facing tables (filters out `sqlite_*`, `*_fts*`, and internal virtual table shadow tables) |
| `GET` | `/api/inquiry/tables/:table/schema` | Column metadata via `PRAGMA table_info` — name, type, notnull, pk, default |
| `GET` | `/api/inquiry/tables/:table/rows` | Paginated rows with optional `?sort=col&order=ASC|DESC&limit=&offset=`. Sort column validated against schema; defaults to `rowid`. Max limit 500. |
| `GET` | `/api/inquiry/tables/:table/rows/:rowKey` | Single row by primary key |

**Security / constraints:**
- Table names whitelisted against `sqlite_master` — no blind string interpolation
- Parameterized prepared statements only — no raw SQL execution exposed
- Read-only — inspection tool, not a data editor
- 400/404 on invalid table names or columns

**Dependencies:** No new repository class — route handler uses direct `db.prepare()` calls for generic table introspection.

**Frontend — Types** (`types/index.ts`): Add `InquiryColumnInfo` and `InquiryRow`.

**Frontend — RTK Query** (`api.ts`): Four query endpoints (`getInquiryTables`, `getInquiryTableSchema`, `getInquiryTableRows`, `getInquiryTableRow`) under a new `"Inquiry"` tag type.

**Frontend — Components:**
- `TableList` — sidebar panel listing all tables with name filter. Click to select.
- `TableSchema` — collapsible panel above data showing column names, types, PK/NOT-NULL badges.
- `RowTable` — HTML `<table>` with sortable headers. Pagination controls (prev/next, "Row X–Y of Z").
- `RowJsonPanel` — slide-out panel rendering a single row as formatted JSON via `<pre>`. Copy-to-clipboard button.
- `InquiryPage` — main page at `/inquiry` with left sidebar (resizable, table list) + main area (schema + data table + row detail).

**Routing:** Add `<Route path="/inquiry" element={<InquiryPage />} />` to `App.tsx`.

**Navigation:** Add `<Link to="/inquiry">Inquiry</Link>` in `Layout.tsx` header nav.

**Future Enhancements (to be flushed out later):**
- Custom SQL query input with server-side safety constraints (read-only, limited result sets)
- CSV/JSON export of table data
- Cell-level editing with POST/PUT mutations
- Row count pre-fetch badges per table in the sidebar
- Column-level search/filter within a table
- Virtual FTS table visibility toggle

### Phase 39: Meeting Notes as First-Class Type

Meeting notes are promoted from a built-in template to a first-class note type
(`note_type = "meeting"`). This enables structured organizer/attendee tracking
outside of note body text, and a dedicated create/edit UI.

**Data Model — Extend `notes` table (`db/index.ts` migration):**

| Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `note_type` | TEXT NOT NULL | `"note"` | `"note"` or `"meeting"` |
| `meeting_location` | TEXT | — | From ICS event |
| `meeting_start` | TEXT | — | ISO datetime |
| `meeting_end` | TEXT | — | ISO datetime |

**New table: `people`**

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | TEXT PK | UUID |
| `name` | TEXT NOT NULL | Display name |
| `email` | TEXT | For ICS mailto matching |
| `created_at` | TEXT | |
| `updated_at` | TEXT | |

**New table: `note_people`** (M:N junction with role + status)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `note_id` | TEXT FK → notes.id | CASCADE |
| `person_id` | TEXT FK → people.id | CASCADE |
| `role` | TEXT NOT NULL | `"organizer"`, `"attendee"`, `"mentioned"` |
| `status` | TEXT nullable | `"accepted"`, `"tentative"`, `"declined"`, `"needs-action"` (only for `role='attendee'`) |
| UNIQUE | `(note_id, person_id, role)` | Same person can be both attendee AND mentioned in same note |

**Template Changes:**
- **Remove** the "Meeting Notes" built-in template from `seedBuiltInTemplates()` in `index.ts`
- Meeting notes are created directly as type `"meeting"`, not via template apply
- Keep other built-in templates (Daily Note, To-Do)

**Server — Extend OutlookEvent type (`outlook.ts`):**
- Add: `organizer?: { name: string; email?: string }`
- Add: `attendees?: { name: string; email?: string; status: string }[]`
- Extract `event.organizer` and `event.attendee` arrays from VEvent (node-ical already parses these)
- Do NOT filter attendees by status — store all invited persons regardless of ACCEPTED/TENTATIVE/DECLINED

**Server — Endpoints (`routes/notes.ts`):**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/notes` | Updated to accept `note_type: "note" | "meeting"` and meeting fields |
| `POST` | `/api/notes/from-event` | Create meeting note from ICS event: stores organizer + attendees in `note_people`, sets meeting metadata, pre-fills Markdown body (agenda, action items, notes) |
| `GET` | `/api/notes?note_type=meeting` | Filter notes by type |

**Server — People endpoints (`routes/people.ts`):**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/people` | List people (sorted by name, `?q=` filter) |
| `POST` | `/api/people` | Create person (`{ name, email? }`) |
| `GET` | `/api/people/:id` | Person detail + role/status breakdown counts |
| `GET` | `/api/people/:id/notes?role=&status=` | Paginated notes linked to person, filtered by role and/or attendee status |
| `PUT` | `/api/people/:id` | Update name/email |
| `DELETE` | `/api/people/:id` | Delete person (cascade unlinks) |

**Server — Note-people linking (`routes/notes.ts`):**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/notes/:id/people` | Link people to a note (`{ personIds: string[], role }`) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/notes/:id/people/:personId` | Unlink person from note |

**Auto-Linking from ICS Event (`routes/notes.ts` POST `/from-event`):**
1. Create note with `note_type = 'meeting'`, set `meeting_location`, `meeting_start`, `meeting_end`
2. Organizer: upsert person by email/name → insert `note_people` with `role='organizer'`
3. Each attendee: upsert person by email/name → insert `note_people` with `role='attendee'` and `status` from ICS PARTSTAT
4. Body pre-filled with default meeting structure (agenda, action items, notes — attendees rendered from `note_people`, not body text)

**Client — Types (`types/index.ts`):**
- `Note` extended: `noteType`, `meetingLocation`, `meetingStart`, `meetingEnd`, `people?: NotePerson[]`
- `Person` interface: `{ id, name, email?, createdAt, updatedAt }`
- `NotePerson` interface: `{ personId, person, role, status? }`
- `OutlookEvent` extended with `organizer` and `attendees`

**Client — "Create Note" flow update:**
- Current options: Blank, From Template
- New picker: **Blank Note** | **Meeting Note** | **From Template**
- Meeting Note option skips the template picker; creates a `note_type='meeting'` note directly with default body

**Client — Meeting Note Editor (`MeetingNoteEditor.tsx` or conditional section in `NoteEditorPage.tsx`):**
- **Header section** (above TipTap editor, read-only until clicked to edit):
  - Title, Date, Time, Location
- **Organizer**: single person chip with label
- **Attendee list**: chips with status icons
  - Green check = accepted, Yellow clock = tentative, Red X = declined, Gray ? = no response
  - Add/remove attendees manually (search people, pick from autocomplete)
- **Body**: standard TipTap editor for agenda/notes/action items
- **Sidebar**: People section with organizer + attendees + @mentions subsections

**Client — CalendarDayPanel:**
- "Create Meeting Note" icon button next to each ICS event
- On click → fires `createMeetingNoteFromEvent` mutation → navigates to new meeting note

**Client — RTK Query (`api.ts`):**
- Mutations: `createMeetingNote` (manual), `createMeetingNoteFromEvent` (from calendar), `updateNotePeople`
- Queries: `getPeople`, `getPerson`, `getPersonNotes`
- Tags: `"Person"`, `"PersonList"`, `"Note"` (people changes invalidate note listings)

### Phase 39.5: ICS Event Identity, Sync & Stale Detection

Handles keeping meeting notes in sync with their source ICS events as the feed
changes over time. Uses pull-to-refresh with a change summary and manual sync.

**Data Model — Extend `notes` table:**

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ics_uid` | TEXT UNIQUE nullable | Links note to ICS VEVENT UID. Null for non-ICS meeting notes. |
| `ics_last_synced` | TEXT nullable | ISO timestamp of last pull from ICS. Null = never synced or manually created. |

No new tables — all sync state is per-note metadata. Existing `note_people` tracks
attendee changes.

**Duplicate Prevention:**
- `POST /api/notes/from-event` checks `SELECT id FROM notes WHERE ics_uid = ?`
- If found → returns existing note (200), client navigates to it instead of creating
- CalendarDayPanel button labels change: "Create Meeting Note" (no note) → "Open Meeting Note" (exists)

**Stale Detection:**
- On each ICS refresh (fetch for visible month range), for every event `uid`:
  - If a note exists with that `ics_uid`, compare current ICS data against stored note
  - Differences to check: `start`, `end`, `location`, `organizer`, `attendees` (list + statuses)
  - If any field differs, flag the note as `icsOutOfDate: true`
- `GET /api/notes/:id` returns `icsOutOfDate` boolean in the response
- `GET /api/calendar/outlook/stale?start=&end=` returns list of `{ icsUid, noteId, changes[] }` for the UI

**Meeting Note Editor — Sync Banner:**
- When `icsOutOfDate` is true, render a banner above the meeting header:
  - "Calendar event has changed" with a summary of diffs (e.g. "+2 attendees, time moved, 1 status change")
  - "Sync" button that calls the sync endpoint
  - Dismiss button to hide the banner until next refresh

**Sync Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/notes/:id/sync-from-ics`:
  - Re-fetches the ICS feed, locates the event by `ics_uid`
  - Updates `meeting_start`, `meeting_end`, `meeting_location`, `ics_last_synced`
  - Organizer: upsert person → update `note_people` (replace existing organizer)
  - Attendees: upsert each person → upsert `note_people` rows (update status for existing, insert new, leave removed attendees untouched — manual deletion is the user's responsibility)
  - Does NOT modify note body/content (agenda, notes, action items are user-editable)
  - Sets `icsOutOfDate: false`

**Off-Calendar / Fell Out of Range:**
- ICS feeds are typically sliding windows (past 30d, next 90d). Old events naturally drop out.
- When a note with `ics_uid` is no longer returned by the current fetch:
  - Calendar: stop showing purple dot for that event (note still appears via note-activity dots)
  - Meeting note editor: show subdued indicator "Calendar event no longer in feed" + last synced date
  - Sync button hidden; data is frozen
- `ics_uid` stays set — permanent link. If the event reappears (recurring meetings expand window), re-attachment happens on next fetch automatically

**UICe — CalendarDayPanel & Calendar Tooltips:**
- Purple dot shown only if the ICS event exists in the current fetch AND no note exists OR note has changes
- "Create Meeting Note" button when no note exists for event uid
- "Open Meeting Note" button when note exists (navigates to `/note/:id`)
- Subtle indicator (small amber dot on the button) when note is out of sync

**UICe — Note Editor Sidebar (meeting notes):**
- Sync status indicator next to meeting metadata header
- Green check + "Up to date" when synced
- Amber refresh icon + "Changes pending" when `icsOutOfDate`
- Gray cloud-off icon + "Off calendar" when event not in feed

---

### Phase 40: People Tagging, @Mentions & Directory

Browsing, searching, and inline-mentioning of people stored in the `people` table.
Builds on the schema and endpoints from Phase 39.

**@Mention TipTap Extension:**
- Custom `@mention` node type, similar pattern to the existing `#tag` extension
- Trigger character: `@` — opens autocomplete popup as user types
- Autocomplete queries `GET /api/people?q=` debounced
- Rendered as an inline chip (indigo/purple color, distinct from tag chips)
- Chip stores `personId` in node attrs (`data-person-id`)
- Inline creation: typing a name not in results → "Create 'New Name'" option
- On note save: walk the TipTap document, collect all `@mention` nodes, sync `note_people` (role='mentioned') — insert missing, remove stale
- Read-only resolution: chip resolves `personId` → current display name at render time

**People Picker (Note Editor Sidebar):**
- Section below Tags: "People" with autocomplete search input
- Selected people shown as removable chips
- For meeting notes: separate subsections for Organizer, Attendees, @Mentions
- For regular notes: only @Mentions section (organizer/attendee is meeting-only)

**PeoplePage (`/people`):**
- Grid of person cards: name, email, total-linked-notes badge
- Search/filter bar by name
- Click a person → expand detail view with tabs:
  - **Organized** — meeting notes where `role='organizer'`
  - **Attending** — meeting notes where `role='attendee'`, with status breakdown (accepted/tentative/declined count badges)
  - **Mentioned** — any note (meeting or regular) where `role='mentioned'`
  - **All** — combined list with role badge per entry
- Add/edit/delete person inline

**People Filter in Sidebar:**
- New "People" section alongside existing tag chips and folder tree
- Click a person chip → filters note list to notes linked to that person (all roles)
- Multi-select: clicking multiple people narrows the list further

**@Name Filter in Global Search:**
- Search bar (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) supports `@name` syntax
- `@jane` → filters results to notes where Jane is linked (any role)
- `@jane organizer` → only where Jane is organizer
- `@jane attendee` → only where Jane is an attendee
- `@jane declined` → only where Jane declined
- Search endpoint updated to accept `?person=` and `?personRole=` params

**Routing:**
- `<Route path="/people" element={<PeoplePage />} />` in `App.tsx`
- `<Link to="/people">People</Link>` in `Layout.tsx` header nav

---

## Cross-Platform Build Notes

- `better-sqlite3`: uses `prebuild-install` for prebuilt binaries; falls back to `node-gyp`. Document Windows build tools requirement.
- Vite proxy in dev mode (`vite.config.ts` `server.proxy`)
- Root `dev` script uses `concurrently` for client + server
- ICS calendar sync fetches from URLs and parses iCalendar data; doesn't require platform-specific APIs
- Canvas auto-save uses debounced writes to avoid thrashing the DB
